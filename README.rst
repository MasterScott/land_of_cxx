Land of C++
===========

Land of C++ is a collection of tutorials designed to learn C++ through the
development of old-school yet terribly entertaining, text-based games.

Several tutorial have been designed with care (and love <3), in an increasing
level of difficulty. Each tutorial contains a compilable skeleton file with the
game description, and a Makefile to get you started. The makefile contains the
typical ``all``, ``clean`` and ``check`` rules so that you won't loose time
setting up a minimalist build environment. When lost, ``cd`` to the solution
directory!

Available Tutorials:
