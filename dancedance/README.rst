Dance Dance Fingers
===================

In DDF, your fingers learn to dance on the keyboard! Try to type as fast as the
letters appear on the screen!

To begin with, a minimal ``Makefile`` has been setup, as well as an even
more minimal version of the ``dancedance`` program. Run::

    $> make

to build the program, then::

    $> ./dancedance

to run it, and finally::

    $> git checkout dancedance/level0

to start the tutorial!
