ORC
===

In ORC, you are a great hero trying to slash as many foes as possible before
meeting a glorious end. Let's use as many C++11 features to write this
old-school, text-based game!

This directory has been populated with a minimalistic C++ source and the
associated makefile. Feel free to compile::

    $> make

And run::

    $> ./orc


You can now checkout branch ``orc/level0`` to start the tutorial!
