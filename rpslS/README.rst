================================

Quoting Wikipedia:

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic selection
method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but
includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a
sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute).

The rules of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:

* Scissors cut paper

* Paper covers rock

* Rock crushes lizard

* Lizard poisons Spock

* Spock smashes scissors

* Scissors decapitate lizard

* Lizard eats paper

* Paper disproves Spock

* Spock vaporizes rock

* Rock crushes scissors

The original rules remain the same.
