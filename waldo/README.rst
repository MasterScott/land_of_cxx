Waldo
=====

In WALDO, you are playing a text based version of the famous *Where's Waldo?*
books from Martin Handford. The goal is to find the ``w`` character in an ascii
art image!

To begin with, the image in ``waldo.txt``, which suits perfectly the theme of
the game, is used. A minimal ``Makefile`` has been setup, as well as an even
more minimal version of the ``waldo`` program. Run::

    $> make

to build the program, then::

    $> ./waldo

to run it, and finally::

    $> git checkout waldo/level0

to start the tutorial!
